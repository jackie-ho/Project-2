# Solar System Neighbors App

This app shows a list of all the planets and some of the moons in our solar system. Each space body has
its own description and various information relating to its size and distance. This app allows you
to sort through the list through searching for the names, keywords in the description, as well as sorting by 
moon or planets. 

Going into the screens for each space object, you can add it to favorites for viewing later on. You
can also leave comments on each planet or moon which would be saved in a database and can be viewed
later on.

## Bugs
When favoriting a planet on the planet fragment, it does not immediately update the favorite list in the
favorite tab unless you scroll back to the first tab.

## Credit
Credit to wikipedia for the descriptions of the moons and planets, as well as the aggregating the images. 
Credit to NASA for the space images. All other images were free for use.

App made by Jackie Ho for the second project in the Android Development Immersive.
